# Build an Apartment

Created by Nicholas Zaverdinos
Duration: 6 hours

Adding models became a lot smoother once I learned how to use vertex snapping!
I enjoyed being able to experience my creation after completion :)
I found the lighting to be quite challenging when it came to reducing any light artifacts and abnormalities.
